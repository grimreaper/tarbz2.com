# tarbz2.com

I made this site because I never remember the options to tar

## features i'd like to add

- the \*right\* way to compress files
- links to better, simpler tools
- links to bash aliases that work for people, if possible
- explanations of the command line flags for tar
- docs for going the other way (compressing files)

honestly I don't know that much about compression if you would like to
contribute, awesome. just write up the best things to do and I'll take care of
the rest
