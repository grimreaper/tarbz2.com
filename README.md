# tarbz2.com

I made this site because I never remember the options to tar

## features i'd like to add

- the \*right\* way to compress files
- links to better, simpler tools
- links to bash aliases that work for people, if possible
- explanations of the command line flags for tar
- docs for going the other way (compressing files)

honestly I don't know that much, if you would like to contribute, awesome
- just write up what's best and I'll take care of the rest.
